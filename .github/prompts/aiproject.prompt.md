The authentication system secures access to the Student Management System. It loads user credentials 
from a file, allows new users to be saved, and checks login details against stored records. Successful logins 
are recorded in an activity log, while invalid attempts are denied. This ensures only authorized users can 
manage student data.

accurate and organized management of student information.

    Student Management System ‚Äì A Capstone Project from the RITA Africa Python Fundamental 
Course! 
I‚Äôm excited to share a Student Management System I built during the RITA Africa bootcamp (tag the official 
RITA Africa LinkedIn page). This project shows how Python can be applied to build real-world applications 
that make data management easier and more secure. 
Key Features: 
   Secure login with file-based authentication 
   Add, view, search, update, and delete student records 
   Generate basic reports on student data 
   Store data in text files for persistence 
   Log user activity for better tracking. 
Skills Demonstrated: 
  File handling for data storage and retrieval 
  Dictionaries, loops, and conditionals for program logic 
  Functions for modular code organization 
  Authentication and session logging for security 
  Menu-driven interfaces for user-friendly navigation. 
This project gave me hands-on experience in building structured applications while applying Python 
fundamentals to solve practical problems.

üéì Student Management System 
A simple Python-based Student Management System developed as a capstone project for the 
RITA Africa Python Fundamentals Course. 
This application allows secure login, student record management (CRUD), report generation, 
and file-based data persistence. 
 
üöÄ Features 
‚Ä¢   Authentication System ‚Äì Secure login with user accounts stored in users.txt 
‚Ä¢    Student Data Management ‚Äì Add, view, search, update, and delete student 
records 
‚Ä¢       Report Generation ‚Äì Generate basic reports on total students and grade 
distribution 
‚Ä¢           Activity Logging ‚Äì Tracks user logins, logouts, and actions in activity_log.txt 
‚Ä¢        File-Based Storage ‚Äì Data is stored in text files (students.txt, users.txt) for 
persistence 
 
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used 
‚Ä¢ Python 3.x 
‚Ä¢ File Handling (TXT) 
‚Ä¢ Datetime module (for logging timestamps) 
‚Ä¢ Getpass module (for hidden password entry)
